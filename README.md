# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Guidance
1. Virtual environment to manage dependencies (optional):
  - Set virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
  - Activate the virtual environment: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Use pip to install NumPy and Pandas: 
  - `python -m pip install pandas`
  - `python -m pip install numpy`
3. Follow these steps:
  - Load and inspect de dataset
  - Identify the questions to be answered.
  - Analyze the data (using Python pandas)
4. Things to remember:
  - Import the package, `import pandas as pd`
  - A table of data is stored as a pandas `DataFrame`
  - Each column in a DataFrame is a `Series`
  - Getting data in to pandas from many different file formats or data sources is supported by `read_*` functions.
  - Exporting data out of pandas is provided by different `to_*methods`.
  - The `head/tail/info` methods and the dtypes attribute are convenient for a first check.
  - You can do things by applying a method to a `DataFrame` or `Series`
